# Comparing OAS "Renderers"

# Plan
* Take a small subsection of the Codat API (Companies, Data Connections)
* Work it up properly to include tags, descriptions, summaries, example responses, linked models, parameters, example.
* Try it out in some renderers, get a feel for what is important, what is nice and what is bad.

# Renderers
 * [Redoc](./redoc.html)
 * [Swagger](./swagger.html)
 * [RapiDoc](./rapidoc.html)
 * [Stoplight](https://dans-just-testing.stoplight.io/docs/playingwithoas/466k6ayziv9at-codat) 
 * [Readme](https://codat-group.readme.io/codat-clone-trial/reference/list-companies)

# Notes      
## Redoc

## Swagger
* Did not support OAS 3.1.X, so examples of models not supported.

## Stoplight
* Can't be self hosted

## RapiDoc

## Readme
* Obviously embedded as part of Readme.
* Synced from hosted OAS file, but only one that can be then edited within ... opportunties for confusion!
