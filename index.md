# Comparing OAS "Renderers"

# Plan
* Take a small subsection of the Codat API (Companies, Data Connections)
* Work it up properly to include tags, descriptions, summaries, example responses, linked models, parameters, example.
* Try it out in some renderers, get a feel for what is important, what is nice and what is bad.

# Renderers
 * [Redoc]("redoc.html")
 * [Swagger]("swagger.html)
 * [RapiDoc]("rapidoc.html")
 * [Stoplight]("https://dans-just-testing.stoplight.io/docs/playingwithoas/466k6ayziv9at-codat") 
 * Readme - not yet uploaded.
